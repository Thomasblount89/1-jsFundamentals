/*
NOTES:
-variables: Are named containers for storing data values and referring to later (We can name them whatever we want)
    - a variable name must begin with letter, underscore, or dollar sign
    - numbers may follow the above characters, but cannot come first
    - Javascript is case sensitive - 'Hi' and 'hi' are different variables
    - no spaces are allowed in variable names
    - camelCase is best practice for naming variables
        -snake_Case, PascalCasing
    - this is good practice because it helps keep everything readable - let myName='Garret';

1. Keyword
2. Variable name (we can name this whatever we want)
3. Assignment Operator
4. Variable value

Var, Let, and Const:

-var: 'old' keyword for variables **In this course we won't be using this keyword often.
-let: 'new' keyword for variables (For now best practice is to use let)
-const: also 'new'; declares unchangeable variable

NOTES:
-declarations: are on the LEFT SIDE of a variable

-initialization: are on the RIGHT SIDE of a variable
    - it sets the value of the variable
    - it incorporates the variabe name (x), the assignment operator (=), and the value (10) => x = 10
