/* 
    - Loops offer us a quick and easy way to do something repatedly

    - there are many kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: repeat until a specified  condition evaluates to false
            - for loops 
            - for-in-loops
            - for-of-loops
            - while loops 
            - do while loops 
            -labeled loops
            - break loops 
            - continue loops 

        NOTE: there is a danger of infinite loops** if this happens close Visual studio code and restart it 

        -for loops take in 3 required pearameters. (parameters are sepreated by a semi colon)
            1. initial expression
            2. condition
            3. increment expression
            these are the 3 things we put in the parathensis after the key word for

//key word      the condition            incement expression and increase it by one each time. its going to run until
